üè† House Price Prediction using Regression
üìå Project Overview

The House Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning regression model that accurately predicts the sale prices of houses based on a wide range of features such as lot size, neighborhood, overall quality, number of rooms, garage area, and more.

The project follows a complete end-to-end ML pipeline, including data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and final prediction generation.

üéØ Project Objective

To develop a robust regression model that can predict house sale prices from the Ames Housing Dataset (Kaggle competition: House Prices ‚Äì Advanced Regression Techniques).

The goal is to understand the data deeply and apply advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling techniques to minimize prediction error and maximize model performance.

üß† Core Concepts Covered

Regression vs. Classification: Understanding how regression predicts continuous numerical values.

Target Variable Analysis: Distribution study and log transformation of SalePrice to reduce skewness.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data using median, mode, and group-wise imputation strategies.

Feature Engineering: Creating powerful new features such as:

TotalSF (Total Square Footage)

TotalBath (Total Bathrooms)

Age (Age of the house at the time of sale)

Categorical Encoding:

Label Encoding for ordinal features

One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical variables

Feature Scaling: Standardizing numerical features for model consistency.

Model Comparison: Evaluating Linear Regression vs XGBoost for performance on regression metrics.

Model Evaluation: Using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ scores for model assessment.

üß© Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Setup

Loaded data from Kaggle via API using kaggle.json authentication.

Set up a reproducible environment in Google Colab.

Combined train and test datasets for uniform preprocessing.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Examined the distribution of SalePrice and applied log transformation to reduce skewness.

Identified highly correlated features such as OverallQual, GrLivArea, and GarageCars.

Visualized relationships using correlation heatmaps and histograms.

3. Data Preprocessing

Imputed missing numerical and categorical values:

Median by neighborhood for LotFrontage.

0 for missing numerical basement and garage features.

None or mode for categorical variables depending on context.

Created new engineered features to improve predictive power.

4. Feature Encoding

Used Label Encoding for ordinal categorical data.

Applied One-Hot Encoding for nominal categories to ensure numerical compatibility.

5. Model Building

Split dataset into training and validation sets (80/20).

Applied StandardScaler for linear models.

Trained two models:

Linear Regression (Baseline)

XGBoost (Advanced Model)

6. Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using regression metrics:

Metric	Description	Ideal Value
RMSE	Root Mean Squared Error	Lower is better
MAE	Mean Absolute Error	Lower is better
R¬≤	Coefficient of Determination	Closer to 1 is better

Results:
‚úÖ XGBoost outperformed Linear Regression with significantly lower RMSE and higher R¬≤ score, effectively capturing complex non-linear patterns in the data.

7. Final Predictions

Generated predictions on the test dataset using the best model (XGBoost).

Reversed the log transformation (np.expm1) to get predictions in the original dollar scale.

Created and saved a final submission file submission.csv for Kaggle upload.
